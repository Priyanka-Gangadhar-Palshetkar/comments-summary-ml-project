COP27 participants arrived in over 400 private jets. What a joke!
Ah ha...the criminals are still pushing this crazy 'climate change' narrative...too funny!
How are they criminals?  Where is your scientific evidence?

@Jay Kanta don‚Äôt be surprised when you drop because of heart problems.
@Jason R so you‚Äôre firmly in the antiscience denialism cult
@Jay Kanta I don‚Äôt have too do anything but point and laugh at slaves
@Jason R then it should be easy for you to bring scientific research supporting your claims.
@Jay Kanta your a puppet
good video
Climate change has always existed, part of earth‚Äôs cycle
Can you cite some scientific research showing that the current rate of warming and direction are "part of earth's cycle"?  

Peer-reviewed research only.
people shouldn‚Äôt blame the government alone we should do out part conserve energy, minimize, carbon footprint
Climate change is a con. The wicked invented it. They fly in their planes, SUVs, etc but we supposed to believe a bunch of satanic wicked liars! Gtfoh
Where is your scientific evidence?
aahah rich and greedy just don't care any of this.
Those who polluted the last century and are continuing to do so, along, with those who are polluting should pay for all the repair work in the coming decades and centuries.
Ignorant
That‚Äôs laughable. No rich person will ever pay for burning 60 gallon a hour in their boat. It‚Äôs only for the regular citizens these rules
Climate Change is a hoax from rich and powerful Europeans. The elites want the earth to themselves.  And they've brainwashed the weak to get it done for them cause the weak and brainwashed  wont  realize it's a human extermination scheme.
@American Spirit Look at you make claims with no evidence, again.

You're just babbling.

Who is this "we" that tried to do what?  Do you have a turd on your shoulder whispering conspiracy theories into your ear?
@Jay Kanta there is no visual proof  You do not have the .money to survive what you've demanded to happen. With millions of idiots  brainwashed  like you having demanded the end of energy..... ...there's no stopping the suffering that's  coming.  We tried to warn you.
@American Spirit Still doesn't change the research and observational research.  

Do you think you know more than experts?
@Jay Kanta  and where in your town/ county/state have you seen  the climate changing from the climate zone you've always been in...to a new climate  zone?
@American Spirit "On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground  Svante Arrhenius  Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science Series 5, Volume 41, April 1896, pages 237-276. "

Such a hoax that we've known about it since the 1800s.
The US and NATO can pay billions to fuel the war in Ukraine but they can't pay a dime for compensation? In the meantime, it's our tax money being used for that while energy companies have record-high profits?
India should have major commitment than any other country
@Zala Yashpalsinh because YOU India and China pollute the most. YOU are responsiblefor this
No, every smart country should walk away from the UN and not look back...unless it's to laugh at 'climate change' narrative.
Why?we dont have money its so simple as that!we still have 250million peole below poverty line which is more than every countrys population excpet china, america and australia so we will first provide them food

WION Wideangle | COP27: Who will pay for climate change? It's certainly not going to be China...!!  China must be laughing it's head off regarding the stupidly COP27 .
India is one of the countries who are at the bottom of air quality index. They should pay. Also, they must feel ashamed by supporting a War Criminal Bloodymir Pootin.
What a silly question. WE, the people, will pay for climate change.
As simple as that.
