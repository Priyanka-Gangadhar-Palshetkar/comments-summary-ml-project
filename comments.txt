@Abhishek Thakur Thanks
@speakers159 keep practicing and it will be fine :)
Planning to watch all the Kaggle videos and then Decision Tree and Random forest explanations for now, and to advanced stuff later. btw, the functional approach bit difficult to catch up with, since I'm still not that proficient with Classes, but still felt it was amazing.
