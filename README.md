# comments-summary-ml-project

## Project Summary

The goal of this model is to provide a summary of comment threads for any given Youtube video in the following formats:

* Paragraph highlighting the key points - "actual summary"
* Word cloud of reactions on the video

## Approach

* In this project, I will be using [Youtube API V3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to fetch all comment threads for any given youtube video id.

## How to use

1. Download all the dependencies by running the following pip command in your terminal

        pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Create a project on Google cloud console and enable Youtube API V3 for your project. Follow instructions [here.](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/overview)

3. Change the Youtube API key in config.py with your project's API key. Please find the details to generate the API key [here.](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application)

### Libraries used

1. [python-youtube](https://github.com/sns-sdks/python-youtube) - to interact with Youtube API
2. [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) - to create rest calls to fetch the comments

## Youtube API V3

Of the parameters listed in

    youtube.commentThreads().list(
        part="snippet,replies",
        videoId=video_id,
        textFormat='plainText',
        maxResults=100
    )
there are two parameters that are required, **part**, and exactly one of **allThreadsRelatedToChannelId**, **channelId, id**, and **videoId**. For the **part** parameter, we need to pass a comma-separated list consisting of any combination of **id, snippet,** and **replies**. The **snippet** keyword will return basic details about the comment thread and the threadâ€™s top-level comment, while **replies** contains a list of replies to the top level comment.

The second required parameter is a filter, and we can choose between **allThreadsRelatedToChannelId, channelId, id, and videoId**.
